# Foreword

First off, *super mega fucking props* to the people who made these awesome libraries, and second, some of these were made personally by me as well!

# Pacific

```Pacific``` is a set of frameworks thoughtfully aggregated into in a single wrapper to help bootstrap iOS apps and allow for faster prototyping and design.

Namely, these frameworks are as follows...

## Http ~ [```Alamofire```](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) & [```SwiftyJSON```](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)

## Logging ~ [```Atlantis```](https://github.com/DrewKiino/Atlantis)

## Persistent Data ~ [```Pantry```](https://github.com/nickoneill/Pantry)

## Sockets ~ [```Socket.IO```](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift)

*These next few libraries are stand-alone repositories because I felt that they where significantly useful on their own. However, I still consider them part of the Pacific's **bootstrap theme**.*

## Image Processing ~ [```Tide```](https://github.com/DrewKiino/Tide), [```AsyncSwift```](), & [```SDWebImage```]()

```
pod `Tide`
```
