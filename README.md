# Foreword

First off, *super mega fucking props* to the people who made these awesome libraries, and second, some of these were made personally by me as well!

# Pacific

```Pacific``` is a set of frameworks thoughtfully aggregated into in a single wrapper to help bootstrap iOS apps and allow for faster prototyping and design.

Namely, these frameworks are as follows...

### Http ~ [```Alamofire```](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) & [```SwiftyJSON```](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)

### Logging ~ [```Atlantis```](https://github.com/DrewKiino/Atlantis)

### Persistent Data ~ [```Pantry```](https://github.com/nickoneill/Pantry)

### Sockets ~ [```Socket.IO```](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift)

### Image Processing ~ [```Tide```](https://github.com/DrewKiino/Tide), [```AsyncSwift```](), & [```SDWebImage```]()

*This framework is a stand-alone repository because I felt that it was significant enough to be useful on its own. However, I still consider it part of Pacific's **bootstrap theme**.*

# Bootstrap Setup

In my humble opinion, I think storyboards are **not** the way to go. The interface is clunky, the segue system is severely limiting, messy, and prototyping is very tedious if done through storyboards. 

For that reason alone, I chose to develop apps programmatically by overriding the initial root view so all the layouts and prototyping is done through code.

It's not that bad when you get used to it, some might even consider that *faster* ;)

Especially with this god given [framework](https://github.com/mamaral/Neon).

*Happy prototyping!*
